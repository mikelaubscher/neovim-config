# My Neovim Config
---
This is my Neovim config. It's been put together incrementally using invaluable sources from [Hendrik](https://github.com/hendrikmi/neovim-kickstart-config/tree/main), who made use of [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). Big thanks for these resources!
